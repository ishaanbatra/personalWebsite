# Personal Portfolio (React + TypeScript + Vite)

A clean, single-page portfolio built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It uses Cambria typography, an off-white theme, smooth section navigation, and fully responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Then open the printed local URL (defaults to http://localhost:5173).
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   To preview the production build locally:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

All portfolio content (experiences, projects, skills) lives in `src/data/`, making it easy to update without changing component code.
